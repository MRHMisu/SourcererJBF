# SourcererJBF:  A Java Build Framework For Large Scale Compilation

SourcererJBF or JBF is a build framework that is capable of building thousand of Java projects at scale.
JBF first takes a vast collection of Java projects as input and scrapes all the required external dependencies from
those projects or the web. Then it indexes these dependencies and compiles the projects in multiple stages. During the
compilation, JBF fixes errors and resolves external dependencies. With JBF, we successfully compiled [117K Java projects](https://mondego.ics.uci.edu/projects/SourcererJBF/jaigantic.html) from a collection of 287K projects downloaded from GitHubs. 
All the artifacts of JBF is provided [here](https://mondego.ics.uci.edu/projects/SourcererJBF/).

## JBF Features
1. **Normalized Build:** JBF produced a normalized built script for each successfully compiled project containing class files( bytecode) and packaged all required dependencies to recompile the project. The motivation behind the normalized build scripts is that the build script structure and type remain the same in all compiled projects. Researchers do not need project-specific knowledge to treat each project individually, and they can automate the execution of the normalized build script to recompile all projects.
2. **Controlled Build:** JBF's one of the core features is its predictable behaviors and usercontrolled. JBF stores the output of the project compilation (both Build Success and Build Failure) in a predefined structure and location. Researchers can control the environment and have the output in a specific destination without paying the effort of exploring different types of project-specific output folders and artifacts.
3. **Accurate:** The JBF-generated build result is as accurate as the projects existing build system compiled output. In our experiment, we randomly sampled projects built by both JBF and the projectâ€™s own build script with 95% Confidence Level and 5% Margin of Error that resulted in Maven (382), Gradle(370), and Ant (368) projects, respectively. We compared the JBF-produced output (class files checksum value) with the projectâ€™s built-system output for all these projects. We examined that JBF got 100% build accuracy with the same number of class files and the exact checksum values.
4. **Scalable:** JBF is scalable from various sizes of corpus. We evaluated JBF's scalability various corpus sizes starting from 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000 to 100,000 projects. JBF shows linear scalability with increasing number of projects in the corpus. We also evaluated JBF's vertical scalability with increasing number of cores JBF corpus building time speed-ups.
5. **Comprehensive Artifacts** For both successful and failed builds, JBF provides a comprehensive output artifact containing: (i) A normalized build script, (ii) Class files (bytecode), (iii) A collection of dependents JARs, (iv) Build command (Invoked by JBF), (v) Build statistics with execution log and (vi) Repositoryâ€™s source code. With all these artifacts, users can rebuild the repository in their local environment and trace it back on GitHub.
6. **Portable:** JBF provided build artifacts are portable. In this context, we specify portability as machine-independent. The package JBF produced for a successful build can be used to recompile the project on any local machine, even without internet access. Since the external dependencies are already included in the package, any local device installed with the latest Java and Ant framework can execute the JBF-provided normalized build script and recompile the project.
7. **Configurable:** JBF is fully configurable for different types of usage patterns. For instance, researchers can configure JBF to run 1) Only JBF build, 2) Only project own build script, 3) Try own project build first, then try JBF 4) copy_source, 5) copy_jars etc. In addition to that, researchers can specify the number o threads for enabling multiple processing, load pre-constructed FQN index, and set the desired output package format and locations.

## Environment Setup & Requirements

- Java Version: JDK-8+ [Preferable Latest Java [OpenJDK17](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/)]
- Ant Version: Ant 1.10 works with ``javac`` from JDK-8+ [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html)
- Python Version: 3.9+
- JBF uses three python packages [subprocess32](https://pypi.org/project/subprocess32/), [chardet](https://pypi.org/project/chardet/) and [simplejson](https://pypi.org/project/simplejson/). The following python packages are
  required to install before running JBF:

```
pip install subprocess32
pip install chardet
pip install simplejson
```

## Executing JBF
JBF can be run with a configuration file or with the command line arguments

- #### Run JBF With Configuration File
The easiest option is to edit the ``jbf.config`` configuration file and execute the ``jbf-config-compile.py`` script.
The file is self-explanatory, and it just requires to update according to host machine physical paths.

- #### ``jbf.config``
``` yml
[DEFAULT]
# The directory under which all the java projects to be compiled exist.
root =./env-test/projects
# Rebuild the projects from scratch. Dependency rematching implies that all projects might not recompile successfully.
rebuild_from_scratch = True
# The file with project paths to be build. Paths in file are considered relative to the root directory.
file = AUTOGEN
# The directory under which all the output build directories will be put.
output_folder = ./env-test/builds/
# An output file that will contain all the output information consolidated.
output = ./env-test/project_details.json
# Copy the project source folder into the build artifact folder.
copy_source = True
# Copy the dependent jars into the build artifact folder.
copy_jars = True
# The root of the jar collection repository
jars =./env-test/jars
# The file that represents the mapping of fqn to jar in repository.
fqn_to_jar = ./env-test/fqn-to-jars.shelve
# The file that represents the mapping of project to jar versions in repository.
project_to_jars= ./env-test/project-to-jar-version.shelve
# The number of base threads to be run.
threads = 2
try_project_build = False
verbose = True
only_project_build = False

## Build as a Service (BaaS)
We also designed a Build as a Service (BaaS) platfrom based on the JBF. BaaS can instantly build a Java project hosted on GitHub.
